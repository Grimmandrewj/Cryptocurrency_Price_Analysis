## Goal
- For this challenge I was tasked with utilizing Python and concepts in unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.
- In order to do so, I was to Prepare the data by normalizing/scaling it, cluster the cryptocurrencies, predicting the clusters, and further utilizing Principal Component Analysis to analyze the data.
- I was to then visualize this analysis within the Jupyter Notebook.

## Method
- First, I imported the necessary dependencies (including the appropriate environment to prevent a memory leak while using K-Means, PCA, and StandardScaler)
- Second, the provided CSV file was converted to a dataframe showing the price changes at 24 hours, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year
- I then visualized the DataFrame in a line plot
- In order to normalize the data, I utilized the StandardScaler module and created a new DataFrame
- A list was created for the k-values with a range from 1-11
- A for loop was used to create a K-Means module for the n-clusters and using a random state of 0
- The model was then fit to the data using the DataFrame, and the values added to the inertia list
- This DataFrame was plotted as a lineplot which represented the first elbow curve
- The K-Means model was initialized using 4, which was the best value for k per the elbow curve
- The scaled data was used to predict the clusters of the groups of cryptocurrencies
- A scatterplot was created to visualize the predicted clusters
- The above process was then duplicated using Principal Component Analysis to further optimize the clusters

## Results and Summary
- The initial lineplot showed the price changes across the above time frames by cryptocurrency (showing the most remarkable change in ethlend at the 200 day and 1 year marks):

- The first elbow curve using the scaled data showed a steep curve which leveled out at around a k value of 4, where the inertia became lower and more uniform:

- These clusters were visualized in a scatter plot, which showed a large number of currencies in two clusters and only one currency in two other clusters:

- A second elbow curve was plotted using the PCA method, showing a similar but slightly different curve which still settled on a value for k of 4:

- The second scatterplot using the PCA method showed more accurate and precise clustering of the cryptocurrencies though the best value for k did not change:

- The elbow curves and scatter plots were visualized together to demonstrate the similarities and differences between the methods:

- Overall, the PCA method appeared to result in a clearer and more precise representation of the clustering of the currencies.  This analysis demonstrated that a method using fewer features for k-values would result in a still more precise visualization of the data.
